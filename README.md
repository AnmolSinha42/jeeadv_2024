# JEE Adv 2024 JOSAA dataset

All this data was already available publicly through the published JIC reports available on the jeeadv website. This is just a more readable form (excel sheets or CSVs).

The goal of the project is to provide all data of the JIC report in a more accessible way to all students in form of an excel spreadsheet which they can utilize make better decisions for the JOSAA councelling 2025 and to also put them in a readable format for those curious about performance statistics.


## Accessing the Data

The Excel sheets and CSV files can be accessed from the `exported_data`  directory in this repository. Simply navigate to the folder and download the required files.

## About the files

### ORCR.xlsx
 
ORCR is an acronym for "Opening Ranks and Closing Ranks". It consists of the opening and closing ranks for each course offered by every IIT. It contains all the data present in the JOSAA website for the same but in form of an excel sheet. This enables the user to compare multiple colleges offering the same branch, check all possible seats available for them at their rank and even more using excel's tool which would have been very tedious if done manually searching each item individually in the website.

### choices.xlsx

An “academic program” refers to the combination of academic program and institute.
Every academic program that a student adds in thier prioirity order(in JOSAA) is called as a "choice".
This file contains the number of choices put for every academic program available in JOSAA 2024.

###  allotment.xlsx
