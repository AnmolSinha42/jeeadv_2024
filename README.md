# JEE Adv 2024 JOSAA dataset

All this data was already available publicly through the published JIC reports available on the jeeadv website. This is just a more readable form (excel sheets or CSVs).

The goal of the project is to provide all data of the JIC report in a more accessible way to all students in form of an excel spreadsheet which they can utilize make better decisions for the JOSAA councelling 2025 and to also put them in a readable format for those curious about performance statistics.


## Accessing the Data

The Excel sheets and CSV files can be accessed from the `exported_data`  directory in this repository. Simply navigate to the folder and download the required files.
